Goal for this project: Build a command line tic-tac-toe game where two human players can play against each other.

Motivation for this project: This is an excellent opportunity to build upon my newly learned OOP knowledge as I put it to the test. The project won't be easy, but overcoming the various hurdles and obstacles should strenghten my understanding of OOP in Ruby.
